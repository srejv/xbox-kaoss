                       Cosmic Sans Neue Mono
                       =====================

                       
A programming font, designed with functionality in mind, and with some 
wibbly-wobbly handwriting-like fuzziness that makes it unassumingly cool.

Not related to other Cosmic Sans from the Internet. This one has Neue at the 
end, and it changes everything (most notably the coolness level). The name 
comes from my realization that at some point it looked like the mutant child of 
Comic Sans and Helvetica Neue. Hopefully it is not the case any more.

Inspirational sources include Inconsolata and Monaco. I have also been using 
Consolas a lot, so it may have some points in common.


Weights, variants and glyph coverage
------------------------------------

It includes some accented glyphs, but has not any kind of exhaustive coverage 
now. It also lacks a bold version, although I will be making one soon. And it 
also lacks a good italic version, which I plan to design later, in a fashion 
similar to Consolas' italic version, with new glyph designs, not just an added 
slant.
